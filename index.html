	<h1> Why I Like Sketching </h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>My hobby is sketching. I like sketching because i can draw anything from dresses to cars and humans to animals. when I sketch it usally is a little hard because I need to figure out what to draw and i can choose a million things. The thing i draw alot now are cars i dont know why but i like the cars how many shapes it has and how cars can be anything like a hotdog. sketching makes me creative reduces stress and it is really calming. But the you can also use diffrent mediums like paint, watercolor, charcol,pencil, color pencil, and much more.
